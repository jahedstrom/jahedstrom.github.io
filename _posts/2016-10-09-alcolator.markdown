## Overview

This simple app computes the wine or whiskey equivalent for a given number of beers at a certain alcohol percentage. 

## Details
The app is written in Objective-C.  Storyboards were used to create the Tabbar based navigation for a simple, clean user interface.  A textfield is used to enter the alcohol percentage of the beer, and a slider control is used to quickly adjust the number of beers used in the computation.
